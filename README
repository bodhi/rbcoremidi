Provide easy access to CoreMIDI for Ruby.

Please note that this is a work in progress. The code isn't tested and for all I know, 
it sets your house on fire, steals your car and runs over your dog and/or cat. So proceed 
with caution.

This works only with Ruby 1.8.6 that comes with OS X Leopard.

= Installation

  # Open rbcoremidi.xcodeproj in XCode and compile it
  cp build/Releases/rbcoremidi.bundle . # There's an installation path in xcode to your system ruby, I don't know how to use it though
  /usr/bin/ruby coremidi.rb             # Should exit with no errors

= Common Errors

  $ ruby coremidi.rb 
  build/Release/rbcoremidi.bundle: Failed to load build/Release/rbcoremidi.bundle (LoadError)
          from coremidi.rb:2

fail, you have ruby installed in ports. Use the full path to the system ruby, like in the installation notes (/usr/bin/ruby)
